# Polygons

Polygons are a type of label that envelop the subject of the label in a polygon defined by just several vertices

They are closer in shape to the subject of the label than a simple bounding box

These are the simple steps you need to take to make a polygon label

1. Select the polygon tool on the right
2. Click on the outermost edge of the subject of the label
3. Follow the edges of the subject and select the vertices of the polygon
4. When you are finished click on the vertices near the pointer and the polygon will be created

You can create vertices and move existing ones to change the shape and size of the polygon!

* Add vertices to the polygon by selecting an edge and dragging the vertex that appears
* Select and drag an existing vertex to move it
