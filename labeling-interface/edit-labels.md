{% hint style="info" %}
You can also press the number next to the class name to select that class
{% endhint %}

#### Changing Label Shape and Size

Select and drag a vertex to move it to correct the shape and size of the label

If the label you are editing is a polygon, it is possible to add additional vertices to the label.

Simply select an edge and drag the vertex that appears on your chosen position.
