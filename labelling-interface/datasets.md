# ðŸ—‚ Datasets

Each labeling project has its own dataset which is a collection of images that are prepared to be labeled. You can view all the images in your dataset on the Images tab of your project.

You can add images to your dataset by clicking the "add images" button on the top right of the images page.

When you create a new project, you are greeted with the suggestion to add images to your dataset.
