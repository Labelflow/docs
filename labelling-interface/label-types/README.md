# Label types

Choosing the right label type for your image annotation project is important. Classification tags will maximize your labeling productivity, while polygons will boost your AI performance and bounding boxes may be for some an acceptable compromise.

Good news, check the Auto polygons tool which creates a polygon by simply adding a bounding box.

LabelFlow supports the following labeling types:

* Image classification
* Bounding boxes
* Polygons
* Auto polygons (a polygon generated from a bounding box)

You can read more about the different label types on our dedicated post:&#x20;
