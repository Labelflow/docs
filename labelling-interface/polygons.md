# Polygons

The polygon label type is defined by several vertices, which allows the user to accurately label complex shapes.

By definition, polygon labels are closer in shape to the subject of the label than a simple bounding box.

These are the simple steps you need to take to make a polygon label:

1. Select the small arrow on the drawing tool on the left and select the polygon tool
2. Click on the outermost edge of the subject of the label
3. Follow the edges of the subject and select the vertices of the polygon
4. When you are finished click on the vertex near the pointer and the polygon will be created
5. Right-click on the label to select/add its class

You can create vertices and move existing ones to change the shape and size of the polygon!

* Add vertices to the polygon by selecting an edge and dragging the vertex that appears
* Select and drag an existing vertex to move it
