# Intro to Labelflow

At Labelflow we build the fastest labeling interface on the internet. The open standard tool for image labeling and annotation for AI and machine learning at scale.

Our mission is to provide the AI community with a solution that seamlessly integrates within their software ecosystem while providing the most straightforward labeling experience.  Labelflow is also open source because involving the users helps us build a better platform that they will like. It doesn’t hurt that it improves our image too. Check out our article about why we are open source here.   Philosophy and link    


“Garbage in garbage out”  


Based on years of experience working in the energy space helping utility companies identifying hazards on the grids, we clearly figured out that it was possible to bring AI at scale on complex use cases, saving time and increasing reliability. There is a “BUT”, there is no secret sauce: the dataset must be large, homogeneous AND accurately labelled.  


Let us take a test case to see how you can leverage Labelflow to bring your machine learning models at scale today!
