# ðŸ–Š Import Annotations

LabelFlow can ingest Labels in the COCO format into a dataset. For that you must drop a COCO .json file in the uploader. The COCO .json file contains the annotations of your dataset images.

* Open an existing dataset or create a new one
* First import your images
  * Press the **Add images** button on the top right
  * Drag and drop your images in the uploader
  * Select **Start Labeling** once the import is finished
* Second import your annotations
  * Press the **Add images** button again
  * **Drag and drop your annotation file in the COCO format**
* Select **Start Labeling** once the import is finished

It's that easy. ðŸ”¥ðŸ‘Œ

This feature allows you to share a dataset with someone: from LabelFlow export the dataset in COCO format, your colleague can then import the annotation file in a new dataset.
