# Workspace settings & billing

The settings tab is where you'll be able to update your workspace's name, your plan and also delete your workspace.

### Name & Avatar

You can change the name of your workspace from the settings tab. Making modifications to the name will also automatically update the Avatar, which helps to quickly identify specific workspaces.
