# ü•• COCO

### Exporting Labels

COCO is a file format for object detections within an image. It describes the boundaries and attributes of labels inside an image which makes it perfect as an input for training AI models.

Once you are finished with your labeling project, select the export tool on the top right.

A small pop-up will appear with information about the number of labels and prompts you to specify the export format. Select the [COCO](https://cocodataset.org/#home) file type and it will download your labels in the COCO format.
