There is for now 2 general purpose AI Assistants (more will come!):

* **DETR - COCO** an object detection AI Assistant trained across 80 classes. [More here](detr-coco.md).
* **ViT - ImageNet** an image classification AI Assistant trained across 1000 classes. [More here](vit-imagenet.md).

As we are launching the feature, every plans (Community, Starter, Pro) have access to the AI Assistant tool so long it remains within a fair usage.
