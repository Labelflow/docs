# Introduction

The AI Assistant tool :drum: assists (...) you in the labelling process! Each Assistant is an AI trained on a specific task.

LabelFlow launched the feature with 2 general purpose AI Assistants:

* **DETR - COCO** an object detection AI Assistant trained across 80 classes. [More here](detr-coco.md).
* **ViT - ImageNet** an image classification AI Assistant trained across 1000 classes. [More here](vit-imagenet.md).

Each AI Assistant has it's own documentation page where the classes of objects that can be detected are described.

As we are launching the feature, every plans (Community, Starter, Pro) have access to the AI Assistant tool so long it remains within a fair usage.
