# ðŸ¥¥ DETR - COCO

### Presentation

The DEtection TRansformer (DETR) model was trained by Facebook on the [COCO 2017 dataset](https://cocodataset.org/#explore) (118,000 images) and is hosted by Hugging Face. You can find its complete description card [here](https://huggingface.co/facebook/detr-resnet-50).

DETR - COCO AI Assistant outputs by default bounding boxes around the detected objects. If the detected object class does not exist in the dataset, the AI assistant will create it.

### Generate Polygons instead of Bounding Boxes

It is possible to transform a bounding box into a polygon by selecting the Post-process option. Note that the inference time will be slightly longer by selecting this option.

### Classes

DETR - COCO AI Assistant is able to detect 90 different classes of objects (some better than others we must say...!)
