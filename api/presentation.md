## GraphQL standard

The Graph API uses the **GraphQL query language**, at modern, open specification initiated by Facebook but now used by a large part of the Web, as a successor to REST APIs. The specification and documentation for GraphQL can be found at [https://graphql.org/](https://graphql.org).The Graph API is implemented over HTTPS, in practice, most **tools made for REST APIs are compatible with GraphQL APIs out of the box.**

## **Security**

The API is available as a GraphQL API over HTTPS. **All communications with the API are encrypted and secured** using state-of-the-art standards. The API is used by LabelFlow's own applications. It is open to integration with customers' IT systems.
